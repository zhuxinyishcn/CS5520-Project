- Persona and scenario: A international student who is studying at Northeastern University and this is his first year to study in a foreign country with a foreign language. Therefore, students initially have some difficulties during the lecture and want to use this app to learn more vocabulary to better understand the lecture. Currently, the app existing doesn't have the customize option to choose words more related to the computer science words, so providing this app can customize the word in the field of student study.
- Trigger: The user gets a text message/email reminder to follow his plan to notify him to study new vocabulary every week.
- Desired outcome: The user gets a notification when he needs to study new vocabulary and gets a weekly report of his study progress.
- Base Knowledge: I expect the user knows the process of how to remember a word(swipe a word) and use their account information to track and review their progress.
- Required Knowledge: The user needs to know their Northeastern University account information. Besides, how to use the progress report to review the new vocabulary every week.
