# More and more new features to my ToDo app

## Apply Room Database Executor

1. upgrade database operations use Room Database Executor instead of using an async task in the Todo app

## Make your notifications more robust

1. Make my notifications can be clickable and the reminder message should be more encourage them to finish their task.
2. By clicking the notification, it should lead back to the todo application

## Implement user accounts and OAuth for authentication

1. I probably will add an OAuth pipeline for user authentication
2. Save user information and display it on the login page.

## Add ability to "share"/export a ToDo to another app "share"/export a ToDo to another app

1. User can share the todo Item with his friends
2. User can put the most important thing as an SMS message to his contact to remind him.
