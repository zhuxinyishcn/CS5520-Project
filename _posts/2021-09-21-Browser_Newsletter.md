### Problem 1: Browser Newsletter

- Persona and scenario: A student whom student at Northeastern University and he gets a lot of unrelated emails, which leads him to forget some important email from Northeastern University (University involvement, Co-op opportunity, internships, full-time opportunity). So he hopes to get the update and mobile notifications of the newsletter base on his preference from Northeastern University. Currently, the email preferences do not offer this specific feature to help students categorize all the emails. This app can be beneficial to the students during their college years as it provides career-related events to encourage students more involved in student activities.
- Trigger: The user gets a text message or the notifications the user would like to know they have an update for the newsletter.
- Desired outcome: The user gets a notification when a new newsletter is released. The user can choose when to get a notification base on their preference. The user also has a chance to ignore all updates and browser all newsletter when he is free
- Base Knowledge: I expect the user to know what type of newsletter they are interested in and decide if they want to get the notification for that update.
- Required Knowledge: The user needs to know their Northeastern University account information. Besides, what kind of newsletter they are interested in and they would like to get reminded when the newsletter updates.
