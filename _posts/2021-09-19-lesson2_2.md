## Things I learned/questions

- I learn the lifecycle function in the Android and when a device, the order of them triggered when a device rotated.
- I learn how to store data of the current state and generated it from the layout when users rotate our device.
- I learned by the view element will automatically be saved across configuration changes, so as developers we don't need to worry about them while developing.


## Homework

1. If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device? Choose one:

- The counter is reset to 0, but the contents of the EditText is preserved.

2. What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs? Choose one:

- Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().

3. When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called? Choose one:

- onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.

4. Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed? Choose one:

- onPause() or onStop()
