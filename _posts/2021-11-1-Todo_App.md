- **APK to download: [Todo APP](https://github.com/zhuxinyishcn/NEUSEA-XinyiZhu/blob/main/Todo_List/app/release/app-release.aab)**

## Things has created
1. I created a 1 mintue later task to remind me intentionally, so it can be easier to test my code function. After the app started, the app will remind you a task need to be done after 1 minute

2. Created basic layout for task creation and list view for Todo Item
3. Made a card view ViewHolder for each todo item distinguish if they complete
4. Create basic layout transitions from the main page to create/edit tasks page
5. A simply for loop to add all tasks an alarm manager to each task in case they need a reminder.
6. Delete task simply by swipe left once, and pops up a message to confirm


## Current Status

1. Completed the main functionality for the App.
2. Send notifications to remind users to complete tasks.
3. Automate pop-up a message on the screen to the user to let them complete a task.
4. Build async task for all database operations: insert, delete, update, retrieve
5. Polish UI to be user-friendly and easy to interact with.
